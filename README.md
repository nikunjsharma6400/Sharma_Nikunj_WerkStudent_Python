## Overview

The pdf_extractor.py to extract dates and values from the given 2 PDF invoices and store output in a CSV and an Excel file. Also, it includes a pivot table in the excel sheet that is also generated by this script. The script is designed to automatically installs any missing dependencies using a requirements.txt file located in the same folder.

## Task Details

1. **Data Extraction**:
    - Extract specific values from three sample invoices.
    - For Sample 1, extract the value shown in the provided image.
    - <img width="289" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cf000ff-c305-4ffe-beb4-1c02a04d06b6" />
    - For Samples 2, extract the value shown in the provided image.
    - <img width="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea6eb368-604d-4dd4-9235-fbc8ec36d275" />

2. **Excel File Creation**:
    - Create an Excel file with two sheets:
        - **Sheet 1**: Contains three columns - File Name, Date (scraped from the document), and Value.
        - **Sheet 2**: Contains a pivot table with the date and value sum, and also by document name.

3. **CSV File Creation**:
    - Create a CSV file with all the data, including headers, and use a semicolon (;) as the separator.

4. **Executable File**:
    - Provide an executable file (.exe) that can run the code if the files are in the same folder.

5. **Fork Creation**:
    - Create a fork of this repository named `LastName_FirstName_WerkStudent_Python` (e.g., `Shovon_Golam_WerkStudent_Python`).
    - Upload your code to this branch. No need to submit a pull request; the fork will be checked directly.

6. **Documentation**:
    - Include an explanation in the README file that a non-technical person can understand.
    - Ensure the code is documented so that a technical person can understand it.

7. **Problem Reporting**:
    - If you face any problems or find it impossible to complete a task, document the issue in the README file of your branch. Explain what the problem was and why you were unable to complete it.


## How It Works

1. **Data Extraction**:
    - The script reads the sample invoices and extracts the required values.
    - The extracted data is stored in variables for further processing.

2. **Excel File Creation**:
    - The script creates an Excel file with two sheets.
    - Sheet 1 contains the file name, extracted data, and value.
    - Sheet 2 contains a pivot table summarizing the data by date and document name.

3. **CSV File Creation**:
    - The script generates a CSV file with the extracted data, including headers, and uses a semicolon as the separator.

4. **Executable File**:
    - An executable file is provided to run the entire code. Ensure the sample invoices are in the same folder as the executable file.

5. **Requirements File**:
    -A requirements.txt file is included to create the environment needed to run the code

## Running the Code

1. Place the sample invoices in the same folder as the executable file.
2. Run the executable file to execute the code and generate the Excel and CSV files.


## Documentation

- The README file contains a non-technical explanation of the code.
- The code is documented with comments to help technical users understand its functionality.

## Problem Reporting

- If you face any problems or find it impossible to complete a task, document the issue in the README file of your branch. Explain what the problem was and why you were unable to complete it.

## Timeline

- The time limit for this task is 9 January 2025.
